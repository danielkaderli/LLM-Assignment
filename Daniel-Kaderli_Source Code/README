Title: LLM-Assignment

Description:

    I created several webistes with different generative programming languages. After testing with accessibility checking software,
    I used the feedback to amend the accessibility issues found in the websites. I did not use Github Copilot or AWS CodeWhisper because
    they required a credit card to sign up for a free trial which I felt uncomfortable doing.
